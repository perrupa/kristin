  One of my absolute favourite dishes: it's fresh, flavourful and perfect for
  leftovers the next day!

Before I went plant based I used to make this recipe with crispy chilli chicken. It was of my absolute favourite dishes as it was fresh, flavourful and packed and perfect for leftovers the next day.
After I went plant based it kind of swept this recipe under the rug because I was trying new and exciting things.
One day this fave crossed my mind again and got me thinking how I could turn it plant based.

That was when I thought a Peanut Chilli Tofu would be a perfect combination to go into this recipe for a plant based option.

The trick with the Tofu is to first press it to drain any excess water. Once it has been pressed, coat it with some oil and then cornstarch and bake it at 400 degrees for about 30 min (15 on each side) to make it crispy on the outside and a bit more tender inside.

I like to use coconut oil for this recipe as it goes well with the dish flavour wise, but you can use a light tasting oil of your choice if you wish.

Prep/Cook Time - 30-40 min
Makes 4 Servings
Ingredients
1 brick of Firm Tofu pressed and cubed
2 Tbsp tamarin or low sodium soy sauce
2 Tbsp melted coconut oil (you can use MCT Oil also if you wish)
3 Tbsp cornstarch
1 Tsp toasted Sesame Oil
1 Tbsp Chilli Garlic Sauce (I use pre bought)
1 Tbsp Maple Syrup
2 1/2 Tbsp natural peanut butter (or substitute any nut butter of your choice)
1 Tbsp fresh lime juice
2 cups cooked wild rice (refer to package directions for cooking)
1 15 oz can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1 Tsp Sea Salt
1 Tbsp Chilli powder
1 Tsp Cumin
1 Tbsp Coconut Oil
Pinch of Cayenne
Pinch of Pepper
2 Garlic cloves pressed or finely chopped
2 Tbsp Olive Oil
2 Tbsp Fresh squeezed Lemon juice
1 small box Baby Arugula
1 Pomegranate seeded

For the Tofu:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees, line baking sheet with parchment paper or silicon baking mat. Cube tofu and put in medium mixing bowl. Add 2 tbsp Coconut Oil, Tamari, and sprinkle over cornstarch and mix well until all of the Tofu is coated. Spread evenly on lined baking tray and cook for 15 min one side, flip and cook 15 min on the
other side.

Roasted Chilli Chickpeas:
Mix the Chickpeas, 1 tbsp of Coconut Oil, Cumin, Chilli powder, Cayenne, Salt and Pepper and
mix up well. Line another baking sheet with parchment paper and add spread them flat and evenly on the
baking tray and bake at the same time the same directions as the Tofu flipping at the 15 min
mark.

For the Peanut Chilli Sauce:
While the Tofu is cooking, in a small mixing bowl add the Toasted Sesame oil, Chilli Garlic
sauce, Maple Syrup, Peanut butter, and lime juice by whisking together until smooth and set it
aside.

Cook the Wild Rice according to package instructions. Make sure any excess water is drained...
the rice should not be watery.

For the Garlic Lemon Dressing:
Mix 2 Tbsp Olive Oil, pressed Garlic and Lemon juice in a small mason jar, shake up and set
aside.

Once the Tofu, Wild Rice and Chickpeas are cooked, mix the cooked Chickpeas with the Wild
Rice and set aside in a bowl. Add the cooked Tofu to a non stick pan and add the Peanut sauce cooking on medium heat
until the Tofu is evenly coated with the sauce and starts to get a bit crispy. Remove from heat.

Putting it all together:
Wash Baby Arugula and place about 2 handfuls on plate, 1/4 Wild Rice and Chickpea mix on top of Arugula, add 1/4 of the Peanut Tofu on top, sprinkle with a handful of Pomegranate seeds and 1-2 Tbsp of the Garlic Lemon Dressing on top and serve!
